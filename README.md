# Bot-Chan

An Anime inspired Discord Bot created to perform various Anime related tasks including:

<ul>
  <li>Post random Anime Cat-Girl pictures from a selection of your choosing!</li> 
  <li>Post Anime OP's and ED's from a selection of your choosing!</li> 
  <li>Generate and post urls from Crunchyroll</li> 
  <li>Search My Anime List by the anime you type</li> 
  <li>Post the latest anime news from Crunchyrolls' News Feed</li>
  <li>And with the source code available to you, even more commands can be added!</li>
</ul> 
RUNNING COMMANDS:
<br>
<b>All Commands are triggered with ' !command + "arg"<i>(If Applicable)</i> '</b>
<br>
So for example:
<blockquote style="border-left:2px grey solid;padding:0px; margin:0px;">
<br>
!anime "Mob Psycho 100"
<br>
</blockquote>
Would give you the MAL page for Mob Psycho
<br>
The news, music, hello and ping commands do not require an "arg"
<br>
So a news command for example would simply look like this:
<blockquote style="border-left:2px grey solid;padding:0px; margin:0px;">
<br>
!neko
<br>
</blockquote>
The other commands are just key-words that the bot listens for. For example, everytime someone mentions a catgirl, the bot will send a catgirl image to the server
